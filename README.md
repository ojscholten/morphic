# poly

[Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_code) refers to the ability of a program to change its structure whilst maintaining its function.
This can be achieved through the use of a polymorphism engine - a construct within the program which acts to manipulate and replicate itself.

This project judges the polymorphic variation of the code by its ability to generate unique hashes in its compiled state.
The goal is therefore to create a code which when compiled and executed creates another program which is capable of doing the same, but whos hash is unique to the first, and as many others as possible.
